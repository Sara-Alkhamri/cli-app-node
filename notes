1. In order to run the bin file directly, we'll need to give it the correct filesystem permissions.
If you're on UNIX, this is as easy as running chmod +x bin/outside

2. add our binary to the package.json file
    {
  "name": "outside-cli",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "license": "MIT",
  "bin": {
    "outside": "bin/outside"
  },
  "scripts": {},
  "devDependencies": {},
  "dependencies": {}
}

3. npm install -g outside-cli

4. Running npm link in the root of your project will symlink your binary file to the system path, making it accessible from anywhere by running 'outside'
